# MedBridge — Frontend API Reference

Everything the frontend team needs to connect to the backend.
You do not need Python, Supabase, or any backend setup.

**Local backend:** `http://localhost:8000`
**Interactive docs:** `http://localhost:8000/docs`

---

## Authentication

Every request except `/auth/register` and `/auth/login` requires:

```
Authorization: Bearer <supabase_jwt>
```

Store the JWT in memory (not localStorage). On 401, redirect to login.

---

## Auth Endpoints

### Register
```
POST /auth/register
Content-Type: application/json

{ "email": "patient@example.com", "password": "securepassword" }
```

### Login
```
POST /auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

{ "email": "patient@example.com", "password": "securepassword" }
```
Response:
```json
{ "access_token": "<jwt>", "token_type": "bearer" }
```

---

## Document Endpoints

### Upload
```
POST /documents/upload
Authorization: Bearer <jwt>
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

file: <pdf or image>
```
Response (201):
```json
{ "document_id": "uuid", "status": "uploaded" }
```
- Accepts PDF, JPG, PNG including phone photos (OCR handles them)
- Processing is async — poll GET /documents/{id} until status = "summarized"

### List
```
GET /documents
Authorization: Bearer <jwt>
```

### Get one
```
GET /documents/{document_id}
Authorization: Bearer <jwt>
```

### Delete
```
DELETE /documents/{document_id}
Authorization: Bearer <jwt>
```
Response: 204 No Content

---

## Document Status Flow

```
uploaded → extracted → summarized
```

Show a loading indicator until status is `summarized` before enabling summary or chat.

---

## Summary Endpoints

### Get summary
```
GET /documents/{document_id}/summary
Authorization: Bearer <jwt>
```
Response (200):
```json
{
  "summary_id": "uuid",
  "document_id": "uuid",
  "summary_text": "Your lab results show...",
  "created_at": "..."
}
```
- Returns 202 if still generating — retry after 3 seconds
- All summaries written at 6th-grade reading level
- Medical terms explained inline

### Rate understanding
```
POST /summaries/{summary_id}/understanding
Authorization: Bearer <jwt>
Content-Type: application/json

{ "rating": "yes" }
```
Valid values: "yes", "somewhat", "no"

---

## Chat Endpoints

### Standard chat (full response, waits for complete answer)
```
POST /documents/{document_id}/chat
Authorization: Bearer <jwt>
Content-Type: application/json

{ "question": "What does my LDL result mean?" }
```
Response (201):
```json
{
  "message_id": "uuid",
  "document_id": "uuid",
  "question": "What does my LDL result mean?",
  "answer": "Your LDL (low-density lipoprotein)...",
  "created_at": "..."
}
```
If the patient asks "tell me more" or "explain more", the AI automatically
returns a longer response.

### Streaming chat (recommended — shows response as it generates)

Better perceived performance on slow/cellular connections.

```
GET /documents/{document_id}/chat/stream?message=<question>&token=<jwt>
```

No Authorization header needed — pass JWT as `?token=` query param.
EventSource cannot send custom headers.

```javascript
function streamChat(documentId, message, token, onChunk, onDone, onError) {
  const params = new URLSearchParams({ message, token });
  const url = `http://localhost:8000/documents/${documentId}/chat/stream?${params}`;
  const source = new EventSource(url);

  source.onmessage = (event) => {
    if (event.data === '[DONE]') { source.close(); onDone(); return; }
    if (event.data.startsWith('[ERROR]')) {
      source.close();
      onError(event.data.replace('[ERROR] ', ''));
      return;
    }
    onChunk(event.data);
  };

  source.onerror = () => {
    source.close();
    onError('Connection lost. Please check your connection and try again.');
  };

  return () => source.close();
}
```

React usage:
```javascript
const [response, setResponse] = useState('');
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);

function handleSend(message) {
  setResponse('');
  setLoading(true);
  streamChat(
    documentId, message, token,
    (chunk) => setResponse(prev => prev + chunk),
    () => setLoading(false),
    (err) => { setResponse('Something went wrong. Please try again.'); setLoading(false); }
  );
}
```

### Get chat history
```
GET /documents/{document_id}/chat
Authorization: Bearer <jwt>
```
Returns array of `{ id, role, content, created_at }` — role is "user" or "assistant".

### Rate a message — OPEN TICKET (James)
```
PATCH /chat/{message_id}/rating
Authorization: Bearer <jwt>
Content-Type: application/json

{ "rating": 5 }
```
Valid: 1-5 integer. Feeds the AI Satisfaction Score KPI. Wire to a star or thumbs widget.

## Appointment Prep

```
POST /documents/{document_id}/prep
Authorization: Bearer <jwt>
```
Response (201):
```json
{

  "created_at": "..."
}
```

```
Response:

  "documents": [...],
  "total_documents": 3,
  "total_summaries": 3,

}
```

## Error Responses

All errors return a consistent envelope — never a blank screen:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error_code": "GROQ_TIMEOUT",
  "message": "The AI is taking longer than usual. Please try again in a moment.",
  "retry_after": 5
}
```

| error_code | When | What to show |
|---|---|---|
| GROQ_TIMEOUT | AI slow | Message + retry button after retry_after seconds |
| GROQ_UNAVAILABLE | AI down | Message + retry button |
| DOC_NOT_FOUND | Wrong/deleted ID | Redirect to document list |
| EXTRACTION_FAILED | Unreadable file | Ask for clearer photo or different format |
| UNAUTHORIZED | JWT expired | Redirect to login |

## Health Check

```
GET /health
```
